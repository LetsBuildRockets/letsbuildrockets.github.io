<h3>Subprojects</h3>
<p>Woohoo!
I would love to know why this shit isn't working.  Below this should be a generated
list of subprojects.</p>

<ul id ="project-container">
<li class = "subProject">
<a class = "subProjectTitle" href="TestRobot">TestBot </a>
</li>

<li class = "subProject">
<a class= "subProjectTitle" href="subprojects/V2">V2</a>
</li>

</ul>
