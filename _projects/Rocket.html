<p>We began our rocketry work in 2013 with small bipropellant engines and have been slowly designing and builing more complex engines. There have been many challenges throughout this project, both technical and non-technical. Part of these challenges stem from being a group of young scientist and engineers. The complexity of rocket project allows us an opportunity to work with other students. We often work with others during summer or vacation months. During this time, we focus on teaching scientific and engineering concepts to students in a capacity that allows them to contribute to our projects.</p>
<p>We are currently in the development and testing of our rocket engines. In the next few months we will be doing a static test of our uncooled V4 engine. During this static test, the engine will be bolted to the test stand with a variety of pressure and temperature sensors attached. This test will allow us to verify our injector geometry and seal. Once we complete a sucessful test, we will move to manufacuting and testing of our first regenerative cooled engine. In a regen engine, the fuel or oxidizer flow through channels in the chamber wall to cool the engine</p>

<h2>Our Goal</h2>
<p>To launch an open source liquid fueled rocket to an altitude of 5km.</p>

<h3>Engines</h3>
<div class = "page-width leftAlign">
<h3>V4 Mark I
<div class="develStatus">Status: Testing</div></h3>
<p>The V4 Mark I is a 300N thrust engine machined from steel. (1018 Mild for the chamber and 303 stainless for the injectors)
This is uncooled test engine which means it can only be fired for a few seconds
before it will burn out.</p>

<h3>Lobster V1-V3
<div class="develStatus">Status: Retired</div></h3>
<p>These were by far the most primitive engines that we have built. They were made of
steel pipe and brass fittings. Most of these engines were powered with propane and
gaseous oxygen. These engines were entirely made to test the feasibility of this
project.</p>
