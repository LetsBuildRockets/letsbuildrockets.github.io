<p>This is a description for the rocket project.</p>

<p>We began our rocketry work in 2013 with small solid fuel engines and have been slowly working our way up. There have been many challenges throughout this project, both technical and non-technical. Part of these challenges stem from being a group of young scientist and engineers. We, however, like to focus on teaching scientific and engineering concepts and strategists to students in a capacity that allows them to contribute to our projects.</p>

<h2>Our Goal</h2>
<p>To launch a liquid fueled rocket to an altitude of 5km.</p>
