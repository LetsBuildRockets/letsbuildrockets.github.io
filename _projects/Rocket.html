<p>We began our rocketry work in 2013 with small bipropellant engines and have been slowly working our way up. There have been many challenges throughout this project, both technical and non-technical. Part of these challenges stem from being a group of young scientist and engineers. We, however, like to focus on teaching scientific and engineering concepts to students in a capacity that allows them to contribute to our projects.</p>

<h2>Our Goal</h2>
<p>To launch an open source liquid fueled rocket to an altitude of 5km.</p>

<h3>Engines</h3>
<div class = "page-width leftAlign">
<h3>V4 Mark I</h3>
<p>The V4 Mark I is a 300N thrust engine machined from steel. (1018 Mild for the chamber and 303 stainless for the injectors)
This is uncooled test engine which means it can only be fired for a few seconds
before it will burn out. The alternative to this is regeneratively cooled engines.
They use the fuel or oxidizer to cool the engine. Our next engine will be a prototype regeneratively cooled engine.</p>

<h3>Lobster V1-V3</h3>
<p>These were by far the most primitive engines that we have built. They were made of
steel pipe and brass fittings. Most of these engines were powered with propane and
gaseous oxygen. These engines were entirely made to test the feasibility of this
project.</p>
