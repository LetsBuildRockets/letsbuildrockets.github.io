  <h3>About Us</h3>
  <p>We are a small group of students that started working on a liquid fueled rocket in 2013. We began with small solid fuel engines and have been working our way towards our short term goal. Since the begining of this project we realized that there is a need for the kind of work we are doing as young scientists and engineers. We started our nonprofit to bring our work into the world and help encourage students to learn and start their own projects.</p>
  <h3>Short Term Goal</h3>
  <p>To launch an open source liquid fueled rocket to an altitude of 5km.</p>
