<h2>V4 Mark I</h2>
The V4 Mark I is a 300N thrust engine machined from 6061 aluminum.
This is uncooled test engine which means it can only be fired for a few seconds
before it will burn out. The alternative to this is regeneratively cooled engines.
They use the fuel or oxidiser to cool the engine. You read more about regenerative
 cooling here. Our next engine will be a test regeneratively cooled engine.
