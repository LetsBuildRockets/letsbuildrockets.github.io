<h3>V4 Mark I</h3>
<p>The V4 Mark I is a 300N thrust engine machined from 6061 aluminum.
This is uncooled test engine which means it can only be fired for a few seconds
before it will burn out. The alternative to this is regeneratively cooled engines.
They use the fuel or oxidiser to cool the engine. You read more about regenerative
 cooling here. Our next engine will be a test regeneratively cooled engine.</p>

 <h3>Lobster V1-V3</h3>
 <p>These were by far the most primitive engines that we have built. They were made of
 steel pipe and brass fittings. Most of these engines were powered with propane and
 gaseous oxygen. These engines were entirely made to test the feasibility of this
 project.</p>
