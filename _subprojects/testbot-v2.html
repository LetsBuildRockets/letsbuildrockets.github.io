Version two stuff.  This page isn't visible yet because I can't get the Liquid shit to work. D:
an image gallery will probably go here or osmething and then I don't know if we are going to still
be adding blogposts or not...?  Or maybe that will just go on the Blog part; no ideaaaaaaaaaa.

<div class = "page-width">
<h3>TestBot v2</h3>
<p>Woohoo!
I would love to know why this shit isn't working.  Below this should be a generated
list of subprojects.</p>
