  <h3>About Us</h3>
  <p>We are a small group of students that started working on a liquid fueled rocket in 2013. We began with small solid fuel engines and have been working our way towards our short term goal. Since the begining of this project we realized that there is a need for the kind of work we are doing as young scientists and egineers. We started our nonprofit to bring our work into the work and help encourage students to learn and work on their own projects.</p>
  <h3>Short Term Goal</h3>
  <p>To launch a liquid fueled rocket to an altitude of 5km.</p>
