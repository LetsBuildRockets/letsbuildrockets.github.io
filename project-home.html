<div class ="page-width">
  <h1>Projects</h1>
<p>I suppose a description of what is on this page.  Splash image is TEMPORARY
and can be changed in the splashImages.css file.</p>

<li>Do we want images as backgrounds instead of colored boxes?</li>
<li>Do we want to keep the colored boxes and add a brief description
  so there's not a lot of white space?</li>
</ol>
