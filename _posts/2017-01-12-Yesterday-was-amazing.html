<p>It really was.  It was totally like the best day ever.  I went
to starbucks and totally got a latte because those are totally like
the best things ever, right?  I also really like scarves.

They keep me warm in the winter when I actually feel like wearing them, and even
when I don't, I'm warm anyway because I have a fever of 113 degrees.</p>

<p>Wow, it's like I'm typing another paragraph or something!  This is totally
  great!  I'm really good at writing useless paragraphs that contain the most
  useless content ever.  I'm sure there are people who are legions out of my league
  but the point is not not think about that kind of stuff because it will make me sad
  if I focus too much on it.</p>
