  <p>Chicken sure is yummy.  I have my own field you know.  I only harbor
    the most free-range chickens.  It's in preparation for when they truly
    feel free.  And when I mean free, I mean dead. </p>

    <p>I wonder why I am writing such useless paragraphs, but you shouldn't
      worry about that.  I am thoroughly enjoying myself as I create these
      messages.  It's like the equivalent of shooting an infomercial where
      35% of the viewers will buy into the product.  Kind of like you, the
      reader.  You keep reading this paragraph, assuming that I'm going to
      say something productive, and I'm not.  Yet you keep reading.  </p>
