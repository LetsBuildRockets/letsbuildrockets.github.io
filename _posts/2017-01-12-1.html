<p>Junkfood is the best.  It's definitely not nutritious, but that doesn't
  mean it's not the greatest thing ever.  I appurrove of it.  I like ice cream
  and potato chips.  I bet they taste great together too.

  I mean I've never tried eating them together, but I've heard about salt being
  in ice cream, too.  I don't know if any ice cream exists with salt in it, but
  that's okay.</p>
